User Story / Gameplay

    Describe the gameplay
        Two player on each side of the screen move a rectangle up or down to block a circle from entering its side.

    What are the conditions when the game begins?
        - The second player is on the right side of the screen
        - The first player is on the left side of the screen.
        - Both player have equal speed and lenght of rectangle.

    Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
        The game ends wins one of the players doesn't block the circle from going passed it.

    What ifs will there be?
        - if (event.which === Arrow.Up)
        - if (event.which === Arrow.Down)
        - if (event.which === WS.W)
        - if (event.which === WS.S)
        - if (positionY > BOARD_HEIGHT)
        - if (positionY < 0)
        - if ("#circle" === "#firstRectangle")
        - if ("#circle" === "#secondRectangle")
        - if ("#circle" === BOARD_TOP)
        - if ("#circle" === BOARD_BOTTOM)



Visual Game Components:
    What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
        - The board is static.
        - The two rectangles and circle are animated.
    
    What data will you need to manage each game component?
        - positionY
        - speedY
        - var WS ( which holds W and S for first player controls)
        - var Arrow (which hold ArrowUp and ArrowDown for second player controls)
        - firstPoints
        - secondPoints
        - round
        - center
        - BOARD_HEIGHT
        - BOARD_TOP
        - BOARD_BOTTOM



Events / Logic:
    What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
        Keyboards events that move the rectangle up and down.

    How do those events affect the data of the program?
        The keyboard events update the postions of the rectangles.

    For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

        For player 1:

            When the ArrowUp is push:
                * The speed is increased by +5
                * The box hits the top of the screen and stops.

            When the ArrowDown is push:
                * The speed is increased by -5
                * The box hits the bottom of the screen and stops.

        For player 2:

            When the "W" is clicked:
                * The speed is increased by +5
                * The box hits the top of the screen and stops.
                The position of the box is reset to 0

            When the "S" is clicked:
                * The speed is increased by -5
                * The box hits the bottom of the screen and stops.

        Starting:

            When the game starts:
                * The position of both rectangles is reset to 0
                * The position of the circle is reset to center.

        Ending:
        
            When the game ends:
                * firstPlayer has 13 firstPoints
                or
                * secondPlayer has 13 secondPoints

        Circle:

            When the circle hits left border:
                * The position of the circle is reset to center.
                * A point is added to the second player.
                * New round begins

            When the circle hits right border:
                * The position of the circle is reset to center.
                * A point is added to the first player.
                * New round begins

            When the circle hits the left rectangle:
                * It bounces right

            When the circle hits the right rectangle:
                * It bounces left

            When the circle hits the top:
                * It bounces back in the oppisite direction and angle

            When the circle hits the bottom:
                * It bounces back in the oppisite direction and angle
